## Phase 3 – Machine Learning Model

In this phase, a Logistic Regression model was applied to predict whether a given traffic accident report would be classified as fatal (i.e., involving at least one death) or not.

### Model Target
- **Target Variable:** `is_fatal` (1 if `Deaths > 150`, else 0)

### Input Features
- Month  
- Location (Urban or Non-Urban)  
- Total Accidents, Fatal Accidents, Injury Accidents, Material Damage Accidents  
- Injuries  
- Driver Fault %, Pedestrian Fault %  
- Vehicle Type  
- Daylight Condition

### Model & Evaluation
- **Algorithm Used:** Logistic Regression  
- **Encoding:** One-Hot Encoding for categorical features  
- **Train-Test Split:** 70/30

### Results
- **Accuracy:** 1.00  
- **Precision:** 1.00  
- **Recall:** 1.00  
- **F1-Score:** 1.00  

> ⚠️ Note: Due to the small and imbalanced dataset, the perfect accuracy is likely overfitting and not generalizable. More data points and balanced class representation are needed for a reliable model.
