# **Traffic Accident Trends in Turkey**

## **Motivation**
Traffic accidents are a major issue in Turkey, causing thousands of injuries and fatalities every year. Understanding accident patterns can help improve road safety measures, influence policy decisions, and reduce accident rates. By analyzing past traffic data, we can identify high-risk areas, seasonal trends, and common causes of accidents.

## **Data Source**
This project uses publicly available datasets on traffic accidents in Turkey from official sources:

1. **Türkiye İstatistik Kurumu (TÜİK) - Road Traffic Accident Statistics**  
   - Annual accident data including injuries, fatalities, and causes.  
   - [Dataset Link](https://data.tuik.gov.tr/Bulten/Index?p=Karayolu-Trafik-Kaza-Istatistikleri-2022-49513)  

2. **Emniyet Genel Müdürlüğü - Traffic Accident Reports**  
   - Detailed police-reported accident data with vehicle and driver information.  
   - [Traffic Report Link](https://trafik.gov.tr/istatistikler37)  

3. **Karayolları Genel Müdürlüğü (KGM) - Traffic Reports**  
   - Information on road conditions, accident-prone locations, and infrastructure impact.  
   - [KGM Reports](https://www.kgm.gov.tr/SitePages/KGM/Site.aspx)  

## **Data Analysis**
- Cleaning and standardizing accident data from multiple sources.
- Identifying accident trends over time and by location.
- Visualizing accident hotspots and seasonal variations.
- Analyzing contributing factors like weather, road conditions, and speed limits.

## **Findings**
This section will summarize key insights after analysis, such as:
- **Which cities and highways have the highest accident rates?**
- **Are accidents more frequent in certain months or seasons?**
- **How do speed limits and road conditions affect accidents?**
- **Are road safety policies reducing accident rates?**

## **Limitations and Future Work**
- Some accidents might be underreported, affecting accuracy.
- This study focuses on historical data; future work could involve predictive modeling.
- Additional factors like driver behavior and traffic volume could be explored.
