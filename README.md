# Weather and Temperature Trends Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project aims to analyze historical weather data to identify trends in temperature and other weather patterns over time. By examining changes in temperature, precipitation, and seasonal variations, we can gain insights into potential climate shifts and anomalies.

##  Motivation
Weather patterns significantly impact daily life, agriculture, and climate discussions. Understanding long-term temperature trends can help in assessing climate change effects and seasonal variations.

##  Data Source
- The dataset will be obtained from **Kaggle** (search for 'historical weather data') or **OpenWeather API** (for real-time and past weather data).
- The dataset will include information on **temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed**.
- If additional data is needed, government meteorological agencies may provide climate statistics.

##  Planned Analysis
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - Obtain weather data from selected sources.  
   - Handle missing values and format timestamps correctly.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyze long-term temperature trends and seasonal variations.  
   - Identify anomalies such as extreme heat waves or cold spells.  
3. **Data Visualization**  
   - Line charts for temperature trends.  
   - Histograms for seasonal variations.  
   - Correlation plots between temperature and other weather factors.  
4. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - Compute averages, variance, and trends over the years.  
   - Identify significant changes in temperature patterns.

##  Expected Outcomes
- Detect **warming or cooling trends** in the chosen region.  
- Identify **seasonal variations** (e.g., are summers getting hotter? Are winters milder?).  
- Analyze relationships between different weather conditions.
